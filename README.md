#ngInit directive

The ng-init directive allows you to evaluate an expression in the current scope.

See indexA.html and stylesA.css how this is implemented

In a real world application you should use a controller instead of ng-init to initialize values on a scope.

See scriptB.js, indexB.html and stylesB.css how this is implemented

ng-init should only be used for aliasing special properties of ng-repeat directive.

See scriptC.js, indexC.html and stylesC.css how this is implemented
